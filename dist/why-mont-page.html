                        <h3>Pracitical Life</h3>
                        <p>These are the very first activities children take part in. They enable a child to develop the ability to look after their surroundings. Through practical life activities, children learn to complete real tasks, which involve eye/hand co-ordination. This increases their capacity to concentrate. This is the best possible preparation for intellectual work.</p>

                        <p>Children gain a physical impression of size and quantity before manipulating numbers. The Montessori maths programme is a gentle journey from quantity to number symbol and the joining of the two, for a greater understanding of mathematics.</p>

                        <p>In a Montessori classroom, reading and writing are intrinsically linked through the sandpaper sounds. Each child uses phonics to explore word building and learns to combine sounds for meaning.</p>

                        <h3>Maria Montessori</h3>
                            <p>Maria Montessori lived from 1870 to 1952. She was the first woman to attend medical school in Italy and the first female Doctor of Medicine there. Through her work with handicapped and socially deprived children, she developed her unique educational method known as the Montessori method.<span> As a result of her further study, observation and experimentation, she found the principles of her method to be applicable to all children. She has had an impact on the field of education in general and the way we understand and teach children today.
                            Montessoriâ€™s influence can be seen not only in the number of schools that bear her name, but throughout the fields of child care, education and child development. Many of her ideas are now part of our common knowledge, language and thinking about children. She was an innovator in the field of education and ideas that were once met with great resistance in her day now seem natural as accepted aspects of childhood.</span>

                <h3>What is the Monetessori method?</h3>
                <p> The need for freedom within limits. A carefully prepared environment which guarantees exposure to materials and experiences.
                    The Montessoi method of education is designed to take full advantage of the childrens desire to learn 
                    and their unique ability to develop their own capabilities.</p>
