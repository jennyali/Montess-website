            <h3>Welcome to Our Nursery</h3>
            <p class="welcome-text-primary">
                Elm Avenue Montessori Nursery is a privately run Nursery offering high quality professional Childcare for families in Chatham and the surrounding area.<span> We care for children from 3 months to 5 years and we are open from 8am-6pm Monday-Friday.

            </p>
            <p class="welcome-text-secondary">
                Our dedicated team of staff understand that children learn best when they are safe, supported and loved. We work hard to provide a stimulating environment where children learn through exploration and discovery.  We follow the government’s Early Years Foundation Stage(EYFS) along side the Montessori Method of Education.

                Children are based in different rooms dependent on their age and stage of development. Every classroom has been specially designed to create an environment where children can be supported to reach their full potential.

                        <p class="extra">All children want to learn. With the freedom to investigate the world around them, they will become active learners.
                            <span>In the Montessori environment, children have the freedom (within limits) to choose their own activities.</span>
